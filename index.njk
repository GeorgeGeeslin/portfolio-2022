        Hi, my name is George Geeslin. I’m a full stack developer in Austin, TX. I’m currently working at Ericsson. I’ve worked a few different software jobs before Ericsson, including eStrategy Solutions, a small but mighty company providing an LMS for online certification for professional organizations and private enterprises. And Frontline Education who make an expansive ERP product that provides everything needed to run a K-12 school district. I've also been an instructor for the full stack bootcamp at UT.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve had the privilege to work with a lot of excellent developers and get my hands dirty on a wide range of technologies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this site as a place to display some of my personal projects and to blog about what I’m working on and what I’ve learned along the way. Hopefully writing about the challenges I’ve encountered and how I solved them will not only be useful to my own growth as a developer, but also to others who may come across my writings.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm always interested to talk shop and to work with enthusiastic people. So, if you like what you see here reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-geeslin/">LinkedIn</a>
