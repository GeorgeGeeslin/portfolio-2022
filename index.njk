        Hi, my name is George Geeslin, and I'm a Full Stack developer from Austin, TX.
        I'm currently working at Ericsson, 
        before that I was a senior Report Developer at Frontline Education.

        {# TODO: How to best describe prior jobs? Frontline, eSS, bootcamp #}

    <p>
        I have a passion for web development,
        which will be the focus of content I post here.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this site as a place to display some of my personal
        projects and to blog about what I’m working on and what I’ve
        learned along the way. Hopefully writing about the challenges I’ve
        encountered and how I solved them will not only be useful to my
        own growth as a developer, but also to others who may come across
        my writings.
    </p>
    <p>
        After initially creating this site, I let it fall dormant for awhile. I guess I just got busy 
        with life and other projects. I'll be adding a few things here and there and hopefully 
        will do a better job keeping things current.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm always interested to talk shop and to work with enthusiastic
        people. So, if you like what you see here reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-geeslin/">LinkedIn</a>
