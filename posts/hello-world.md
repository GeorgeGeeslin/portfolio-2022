Hi, I'm George Geeslin and if you're reading this then you're on my blog. I'm not sure what brought you here, but I hope that you'll find something useful.

I'm a web developer, so that's what I'll be writing about. Mostly about things I've built and challenges I encountered along the way, maybe the odd tutorial here or there. Truthfully, I'm doing this for myself. The goal is to become a better developer. There are lots of [articles](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/if-youre-a-developer-you-should-start-blogging-and-here-s-why-b5cb2951d95c) on the internet about why [blogging](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) is good for developers.

I'll also be displaying some personal projects on this site over on the Projects pages.

I suppose that's all for now, but expect some more interesting things in the future.

Hello world, nice to meet you.
