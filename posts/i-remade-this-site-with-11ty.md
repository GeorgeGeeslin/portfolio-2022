In a previous post (directly below this post) I wrote about using Gatsby to build this portfolio site. In that post I go over some of the things that are nice about Gatsby and how to get started. In this post I’ll go over why I decided to move away from Gatsby and also provide a few resources about how to get started.

 Like I said, I built this portfolio site with Gatsby, but after having the site up for awhile some cracks started to appear. Gatsby is weighty (5.36 MB). It’s got a lot of dependencies, and the plugins I was using meant even more dependencies. I reached a point where Dependabot was frequently emailing me about the security vulnerabilities in my dependencies. I didn’t want to disappoint my dear friend Dependabot, but inevitably updating all those dependencies caused breaking changes. Now I could no longer build the site when deploying to Netlify. Strangely, when running Netlify CLI locally I could build it, but that just made things harder to troubleshoot because it meant I couldn’t reproduce the issue. Rather than put in a lot of work debugging I decided it was time for a rewrite. Hopefully one that would leave me with a site that’s a little easier to manage. 

That lead me to trying Eleventy (366KB if you were wondering):

Long ago, when I was first becoming serious about learning web development I tried out creating static sites using Jekyll. Eleventy felt more similar to what I remember of Jekyll than to Gatsby. Gatsby lets you write React components to create your site’s UI, which is great if you like React. Like Jekyll, Eleventy takes the approach of layout templates. These contain markup that will wrap around your content. 

Layout templates can inherit from other layout templates, so what you get is an additive approach rather than a component based approach. Whereas Jekyll uses Liquid as its templating language, Eleventy supports many different templating languages, so check out the list in the documentation and choose the one you like. If you don’t have a preference, I recommend Nunjucks simply because it seems the Eleventy community has coalesced around it. Most of the examples I found online about how to do different things in Eleventy used Nunjucks.

Eleventy certainly feels like it's trying to be pretty simple to use, where markup is markup (generated via templates) and javascript isn't the center of the universe. I think this is a good approach for simpler sites. This portfolio site is simple enough that it could easily just be written in HTML and CSS. The reason not to go that way is that authoring new posts in HTML is tedious and I'd rather have the convenience of using a CMS, or at least writing posts in markdown.

## Resources I used to quickly get started.

At least do the two tutorials under “Making a simple web site with the simplest static site generator”
